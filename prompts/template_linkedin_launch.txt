### ROLE: 
Act as a world-class Technical Developer Advocate and Senior Software Architect. Your specialty is "Product-Led Content" that speaks directly to the pain points of experienced engineers who have zero patience for AI-generated clichés or marketing fluff.

### CONTEXT:
I am launching a new project on GitHub and I need a high-impact introduction for both my LinkedIn network and the GitHub README. The content must sound like it was written by a battle-hardened engineer who solved a real problem, not an LLM.

### TASK:
Write a high-impact project introduction for the following project:
- **Project Name:** [INSERT PROJECT NAME]
- **The Pain Point:** [e.g., AI agents hallucinate success or generate spaghetti code]
- **The Solution:** [e.g., A validated context architecture to govern agent behavior]
- **Key "Named" Features:** [e.g., Neural Gavel, Truth Protocol, Modular Memory]
- **Target Audience:** [e.g., Senior Software Engineers and AI Architects]

### WRITING CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL):
1. **THE HOOK:** Start with a "Brutally Honest" or cynical statement about a common industry failure. No "In the fast-paced world..." openings.
2. **NO FLUFF:** Strictly avoid words like "Revolutionary," "Cutting-edge," "Innovative," or "Game-changing." 
3. **SENTENCE STRUCTURE:** Use short, punchy sentences. Use a "Skeptical but Capable" tone.
4. **CONCEPT BRANDING:** Treat features as "Protocols" or "Architectures" to give them technical weight.
5. **LINKEDIN FORMATTING:** Since LinkedIn does not support Markdown, use ONLY:
    - ALL CAPS for emphasis on key terms.
    - Professional emojis (⚡, 🏛️, 🔹, 🤥) for visual hierarchy.
    - Double line breaks for readability.
6. **THE "SENIOR" VOICE:** Sound like a person who has spent months fighting this specific problem and finally built the tool they wished existed.

### OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
- **The Hook:** A 1-2 line punchy opening that triggers "relatability" in the reader.
- **The Conflict:** Explain why simple solutions (like basic prompting) fail at scale.
- **The Reveal:** Introduce [PROJECT NAME] as the architectural fix.
- **Feature Deep-Dive:** Use a bulleted list of the Named Features with 1-sentence technical explanations.
- **The CTA:** A humble but confident request for feedback, GitHub stars, or DMs for collaboration.
