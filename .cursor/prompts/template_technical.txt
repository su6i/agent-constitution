### ROLE: Lead Systems Architect
### TASK: Write the `docs/TECHNICAL.md` for [INSERT PROJECT NAME]

- **AUDIENCE**: Junior Developers or Contributors who want to *extend* the project.
- **TONE**: Educational, strict, structured, but "Peer-to-Peer".
- **ANTI-AI RULES**:
    - BANNED WORDS: "Furthermore", "Thus", "Consequently", "Utilize" (use "Use"), "Leverage".
    - Do not summarize the obvious ("This function adds two numbers"). Explain *why* it exists.
    - No "Introduction" paragraphs that say nothing. Get to the architecture immediately.

### STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):
1.  **Architecture Overview**:
    - ASCII Tree of the project.
    - Explanation of the "Core Loop" or main logic flow.
2.  **Key Components**:
    - Table listing major classes/functions and their responsibility.
3.  **Extension Guide (The "Zero-to-Hero" Tutorial)**:
    - A step-by-step tutorial on how to add a *new feature*.
    - Example: "How to add a new Command" or "How to add a new AI Model".
    - MUST include code snippets for each step.
4.  **configuration**:
    - Explanation of `config.yaml` and `.env` keys.

### CONSTRAINTS:
- Code blocks must have language tags (python, bash).
- Be extremely specific about file paths.
