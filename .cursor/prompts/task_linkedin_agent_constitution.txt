### ROLE: Developer Advocate (Senior Level)
### TASK: Write a Viral LinkedIn Post for "Agent Constitution"

- **CONTEXT**: We just released `agent-constitution`, a strict governance protocol for AI Agents (Cursor/Windsurf).
- **PROBLEM**: Everyone is building Agents, but they are messy, hallucinate, and delete files.
- **SOLUTION**: A "Context Architecture" that forces structure.
- **KEY FEATURES**:
    - The "Neural Gavel" (Strict .cursorrules).
    - Truth Protocol (Must run `ls` to verify).
    - Modular Memory (Workflows split by task).

### OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):
1.  **Hook**: Stop scrolling. "Your AI Agent is lying to you."
2.  **The Fix**: Introduce the Constitution.
3.  **The "Wow"**: Mention the "Neural Gavel" or "Context Architecture".
4.  **Call To Action**: Link to repo.
5.  **Tone**: Brutally honest, high-signal, zero fluff.

### BANNED WORDS:
- "Unlock", "Revolutionize", "Game-changer", "Embark", "Dive in".
